# Strong Start

### Live Site: [Strong Start](https://strong-start.vercel.app/)

## üåç Project Overview

Strong Start is a platform designed to help **refugees quickly integrate into their new communities** by matching them with local nonprofit services.

Nonprofits can add and manage their available services (housing, food, education, legal aid, healthcare, etc.), and refugees can input their needs and receive **personalized recommendations** based on location, availability, and relevance.

This project began as a **capstone collaboration with a refugee nonprofit in Maryland**, where disorganized data and difficulty connecting refugees with services highlighted the need for a structured, easy-to-use tool.
